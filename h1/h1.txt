1.) Step 1. Compare each letter of each word, starting with the first
            letters, to each other. If the letters are the same go to the next
            letter. Repeat until the two letters do not match.

    Step 2. Once you find out which two letters do not match, determine their
            assigned numerical values. Be sure to take into account if the
            letters are capitalized or not.
    
    Step 3. Subtract the second letter's value FROM the first letter's value.
            State the absolute value of the difference in values. If the words
            are identical, make sure your output is "0".


2.) Step 1. Move forward until sensing a wall or reaching goal.

    Step 2. If a wall is sensed, turn left 90 degrees. 

    Step 3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until goal is reached.


3.) Step 1. Any person with their own ID card may leave

    Step 2. Have everyone line up in a single file line. 

    Step 3. Have the first person trade ID cards with each person in the line
            until they have their own ID card. Once they have their card they
            may leave. Anyone else who might have also acquired their card in
            this manner, may leave too. 

    Step 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until everyone has their own ID card.
