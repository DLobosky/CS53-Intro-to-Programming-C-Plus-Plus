1.) Step 1. Compare each letter of each word, starting with the first
            letters, to each other. If the letters are the same go to the next
            letter.

    Step 2. Repeat until the two letters do not match. Once you find out which 
            two letters do not match, determine their assigned numerical values.
            Be sure to take into account if the letter is capitalized or not.
    
    Step 3. Subtract the second letter's value FROM the first letter's value.
